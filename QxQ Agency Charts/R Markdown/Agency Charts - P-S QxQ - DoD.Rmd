## Products vs Services: Quarter by Quarter Agency Charts
### Civilian Agencies or Military Branches

This script will produce the products vs services quarter by quarter stacked bar chart for the entirety of DoD.  DoD required a different script since the file is too large for BGOV to download.  To build this chart you will have to query BGOV for each individual number.  The file needed is **X:/1 Marielle Folder/Data Sets/Government-Wide Data/csv/To Build/Defense Serv-Prod Data by quarter.csv**

If you need to pull an additional fiscal quarter of data, use BGOV:

+ Open the Contracts Intelliegence Tool
+ Click **+ More Fields**
+ Select **Transaction Signed Date** and **Product Service Code (PSC) / Federal Supply Code (FSC)**, then click **UPDATE**
+ Type the desired **Funding Agency** into the box and select
+ Scroll down to where it says **Transaction Signed Date** to specify for which quarter you want values
+To get just the services value, go to **Product Service Code (PSC) / Federal Supply Code (FSC)** and select each category that starts with a letter (A-Z).  That would look like:

![](X:/1 Marielle Folder/Other/Services BGOV image.png)

***It would be useful to save this search in BGOV so you don't have to redo it each time.***
    
+ Copy the value for Services into the excel spreadsheet
+ If you need another value, run through the same steps; Otherwise run the same query for total contract value (without the PSC field)
+ Subtract the Services value from the total value to get the Products value and enter that into the excel file
+ Save the Excel document

Note: Since DoD is 3 months behind, the DoD number will be available and stable around 3 months and 15 days after the desired quarter.

The code is located in the R File **Agency P-S QxQ Chart - DoD** within **X:/1 Marielle Folder/R Scripts/Useful PSC Scripts/QxQ Agency Charts**

First load the necessary packages and identify your location for saving your chart (set the working directory) and read in your saved dataset. Run the following code (*Highlight it* and click __Run__ in the top right corner to execute the highlighted code):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
options(scipen=999)   

setwd("X:/1 Marielle Folder/Visualizations/Agency Charts/QbyQ charts/Product-Service")
data <- read_csv("x:/1 Marielle Folder/Data Sets/Government-Wide Data/csv/To Build/Defense Serv-Prod Data by quarter.csv")
```

Process the data, by running the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

data$Year = as.character(data$Year)

data.civdef_total <- data %>%
  rename(civ_def = "Civ/Def",
         total_obligations = "Contract Obligations (in Billions)") %>%
  filter(Year %in% 2017:2019) %>%
  group_by(Year, civ_def) %>%
  mutate(label_y = cumsum(total_obligations))

data.civdef_total$Year = as.character(data.civdef_total$Year)

data.civdef <- data %>%
  rename(civ_def = "Civ/Def",
         total_obligations = "Contract Obligations (in Billions)") %>%
  filter(Year %in% 2017:2019) %>%
  group_by(Year, civ_def) %>%
  mutate(label_y = cumsum(total_obligations),
         prop = 100*total_obligations/sum(total_obligations)) %>%
  mutate(FYYear = paste("FY",Year, sep = ""))

```

Note: Identify which years you want displayed and fill in the date range, without quarters, in the chart in the line

    filter(`Fiscal Year` %in% c(2017:2019)) %>%  

The above will have 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.  When you want to display other years, say 2017 through 2020, fill in the **Year ==** as follows:

    filter(Year == **2017:2020**) %>%

If you have just pulled Q4 Defense data (the first fiscal quarter has just ended), note that the chart will only have data from the previous year, not the current year, so make sure the second to last line refects that.

Next, create the barplot. Run the following:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

plot <- ggplot(data.civdef, aes(x = FYYear, y = total_obligations, fill = factor(Quarter, levels = c("Q4","Q3", "Q2","Q1")))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "Black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(total_obligations, digits = 1), y = label_y), size = 4, vjust = 1.5, fontface = "bold")+
  geom_text(data = subset(data.civdef
                          , Year != 2019
                          ), aes(label = sprintf('%.0f%%', prop), y = label_y), size = 4, vjust = 3, fontface = "bold")+
  stat_summary(fun.y = sum, aes(label = ..y.., group = Year),
               geom = "text", vjust = -.5, size = 5, fontface = "bold")+  
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Quarter", values = brewer.pal(9, "Blues")[c(1,2,4,6)])+
  facet_grid(~civ_def, labeller = label_wrap_gen(20))+
  labs(x="Fiscal Year", y = "Contract Obligations (in) Billions", 
       title = "Defense Contract Obligations Comparison FY16-FY19",
       subtitle = NULL) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = 3, size = 24, face = "bold"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18, face = "bold"),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, face = "italic"),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 20), 
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        panel.spacing = unit(4, "lines"))

plot
```

Three fields may need to be changed in the above.  

1. Whichever year has any incomplete year displayed, plug that into the following line, replacing the 2019 (if a year other than 2019):  

    , Year != 2019
    
If all years are complete, put a # before this line so that it reads

    #, Year != 2019
    
2. If you changed the dollar division in the last step, change **Billions** to **Millions** or **Thousands** in the line that reads 

    labs(y = "Contract Obligations (in) Billions",

3. To make sure the Chart title reflects the intended years, if need be change the line
    
    title = "Defense Contract Obligations Comparison FY16-FY19",



The plot should appear in the window at the bottom right.  If it doesn't, make sure you ran all the lines above and that there are no typos in your changes.  to see it larger, push the **Zoom** button.

If the plot needs to be changed after viewing, make the necessary changes and rerun the script.  If satisfied with the plot, save it as a JPG ih the directory you specified above. To do so, run the following: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("Defense Contract Obligations by Quarter - FY17-FY19 - P-S.jpg", plot, width = 13, height = 6.5, units = "in")
```
